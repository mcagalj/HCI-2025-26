# Figma Prototypes

## Information architecture (IA)

Based on typical users and typical tasks to be supported by your digital product, and before creating wireframes and prototypes, you should determine the best way to structure, label and organize information in your digital product/application. This will represent a blueprint of your application/website and is known as Information Architecture (IA). How you organize the information in your digital product will directly affect how users interact with it.

> Information architecture (IA) helps users answer the question _“Where am I and where can I find information/service I’m looking for?”_.

Information architecture plays a crucial role in shaping sitemaps, wireframes, hierarchies, navigation, and metadata.

Some techniques used to design and evaluate information architecture of a digital product:

- User interviews
- [User Personas](https://youtu.be/XnG4c4gXaQY?si=Y9kI7TxMG6iU7uHb)
- [Card Sorting](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-card-sorting/)

## Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the structure and organization of a website or digital product. It outlines the hierarchy of pages and how they are interconnected.

> Sitemaps are informed by information architecture and are related to URL structure decisions.
